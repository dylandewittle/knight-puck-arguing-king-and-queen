# A Unique Board Game: The Knight, The Puck, and Arguing King and Queen 

### Description:

In this game, you have two knights on each side of the board. There are 2 white knights, and there are 2 black knights. Each one has a hockey puck. Your objective is to move the knights, and pass the hockey puck optimally until it ends up in a your teams knights hand on the other side of the board (aka. in enemy territory). 

There is one interesting catch though. On the middle row of the board, the king and queen can move freely along the horizontal. In the case in which they collide on any turn, the opposing team can not surpass while the king and queen resolve their argument. Resolution can only occur after 2 full-turns, inclusive of when the conflict started.
